## OVERVIEW

This project simulates the complex behavior of plasma within a tokamak reactor. Originally a 2D cross-sectional simulation, it has been upgraded to a full **3D volumetric experience**.

The simulation combines:
1.  **Plasma Physics Engine**: Calculates particle trajectories (Lorentz force), Coulomb collisions, and D-T fusion reactions.
2.  **Volumetric Raytracing**: A custom compute shader (`tokamak_raytrace.comp`) performs real-time raymarching to render the plasma density, temperature gradients, and the reactor vessel with physically-based shading.
3.  **Interactive Controls**: Full orbit camera control and real-time parameter tuning via ImGui.

## FEATURES

### Physics Simulation
- **3D Magnetic Confinement**: Particles follow helical paths along the two magnetic field lines (toroidal and poloidal (calculated)) in a torus.
- **Fusion Reactions**: Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) fusion producing Alpha particles and Neutrons.
- **Thermal Plasma**: Maxwellian velocity distribution at 150 million Kelvin.
- **Particle Behavior**: Coulomb repulsion, Debye shielding, and boundary reflection.

### Visual & Rendering
- **Volumetric Raytracing**: Real-time accumulation of plasma density and emission using raymarching.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Plasma glows based on density and temperature; fusion events create bright flashes.
- **Reactor Vessel**: Physically-based rendering (PBR) of the tokamak interior.
- **ImGui Integration**: Real-time control over simulation parameters (under development).

###  Camera & Controls
- **Orbit Camera**:
    - **Rotate**: Left Mouse Button + Drag
    - **Pan**: Right Mouse Button + Drag
    - **Zoom**: Mouse Scroll Wheel
- **Keyboard**:
    - **ESC**: Exit simulation

## COMPILATION

The project now uses **CMake** for building.

### Prerequisites
- **OpenGL 4.3+** (Required for Compute Shaders)
- **CMake 3.20+**
- **C++17 Compiler** (MSVC recommended on Windows)

### Build Instructions (Windows)

1.  Open the project folder in a terminal.
2.  Create a build directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
3.  Configure with CMake:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
4.  Build the project:
    ```bash
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```
5.  Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./Release/FusionTokamakSim.exe
    ```

*Note: The current CMake setup supports Windows and Ubuntu. On Linux, dependencies are fetched automatically during CMake configure.*

### Build Instructions (Ubuntu)

The project can now be built directly on Ubuntu using CMake. Dependencies (`GLFW`, `GLAD`, `GLM`, `ImGui`) are fetched automatically during configure.

1. Install required system packages:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git pkg-config \
      libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev \
      libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev wayland-protocols libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
    ```

2. Configure and build:
    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build-ubuntu
    cmake --build build-ubuntu -j
    ```

3. Run:
    ```bash
    ./build-ubuntu/FusionTokamakSim
    ```

Notes:
- First configure/build requires internet access for dependency download.
- Requires an OpenGL 4.3+ capable GPU/driver for compute shaders.

## PHYSICS DOCUMENTATION

See **PHYSICS_LECTURE.md** for:
- Detailed derivations of magnetic confinement.
- Fusion cross-sections and reaction rates.
- Plasma stability and tokamak geometry.

## SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY & LIMITATIONS

This simulation implements:
- ✓ Lorentz force (v × B)
- ✓ D-T Fusion energy release (17.6 MeV)
- ✓ Volumetric plasma density visualization
- ✓ Toroidal confinement geometry

**Simplifications**:
- The raytracer visualizes a density field derived from particle positions/functions, which is an approximation of the discrete particle data for performance.
- Relativistic effects are ignored.
- Full Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) fluid simulation is approximated by particle kinetics.

**Note**: Rendering volumetric plasma is GPU-intensive. If you experience low framerates, try reducing the window size or adjusting the raymarching step size in `tokamak_raytrace.comp`.
